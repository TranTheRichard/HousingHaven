## What is Housing Haven

Housing Haven is a project developed by a group of college students who want to help people find affordable places to live with the assistance of Generative AI.

## Why Housing Haven
Living in California can be very costly nowadays, and finding an affordable place is even harder to find now. However, with Housing Haven, users can find affordable places to live in your area based on the information they provide. Housing Haven also helps users find local government assistants based on the information they put in. Additionally, Housing haven also features a chat box that highlights users top priorities based on what information the user gives.

## My contrabution
My main contribution for this group project was the addition of the audio recording feature that would create profiles based on what was said. Using both Streamlit and OpenAI, the code I developed would allow users to speak into a microphone recording the audio into a file. Then that audio file would be transcribed into a text file before letting the OpenAI read and analyze the text. Before creating a profile that would be used to create a roommate matching feature.
